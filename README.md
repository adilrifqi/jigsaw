# JIGSAW

Program State Visualizer with User Defined Representation Conversion

## Description

JIGSAW is a VSCode extension that helps in debugging Java programs by providing convertible visual representations. It has two main features:
* **Visualization:**<br/>
Displaying an additional representation of the debuggee Java program in the form of a graph; where nodes are Java objects are edges are references between them.
* **User-Defined Representation Conversion:**<br/>
The program state can be made to be represented in a different manner that allows for concise program comprehension. The behavior of such conversions is defined through a DSL with metaprogramming features that provide context.
